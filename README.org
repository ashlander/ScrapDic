* Description

    *ScrapDict* is dedicated to add more structuring to *ScrapBook* (Firefox extension at [[https://addons.mozilla.org/uk/firefox/addon/scrapbook/]] ). So instead of a list, it could be represented in a *Freemind* way ( [[http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page]] )

    It relies on user tags, which should be added to the *ScrapBook* page comment section. Each tag should start from # sign and be placed at the top of comment. Each new line should represent new tag. In order to separate tags and text comment use empty line.

* Usage

    Find *ScrapBook* (e.g. ~/.mozilla/firefox/xxxxxxx.default/ScrapBook/data/) data directory, then go to projects root directory and run

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    python src/main.py /path/to/scrapbook/data_directory /path/to/freemind.mm
#+END_EXAMPLE 

* Versions

    Should work for linux. If you would like to test/adapt it for e.g. Windows - be my guest.

    I took versions I have locally, so this is mostly for myself, however if you will find it useful - nice :). Write me if you have some problems there. No warranty however that I will look into problems for older versions ScrapBook/Freemind. I do know about new *Freemind* v1.0.0, not tested it. So if you happen to try it out, tell me.

* TODO
